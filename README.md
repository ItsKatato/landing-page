# landing-page

Hi everyone! This is my first major project for TOP (The Odin Project). The main objective was to create a landing page using a design image that we were given. To my surprise I didn't run into many issues when making this. I also found a new love for using flexbox, I'm able to layout the page exactly how I want it without having to worry about doing tough calculations to get the margin and padding correct. We weren't taught about how to make the layout nice on mobile devices yet, so sorry if it looks off. I might come back in the future and make some edits! Overall this was a pretty fun project!
